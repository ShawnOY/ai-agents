- **Auto Scaling Groups**: Automatic scaling based on CPU, memory, and request metrics
- **Database Clustering**: PostgreSQL with read replicas for improved performance
- **Redis Clustering**: High availability cache with automatic failover

**Scalability Planning:**
```
Traffic Tier          | Users        | Infrastructure
---------------------|--------------|------------------
Tier 1 (Launch)     | 0-10K        | 2 EC2 instances, 1 DB instance
Tier 2 (Growth)     | 10K-100K     | 4 EC2 instances, 2 DB instances
Tier 3 (Scale)      | 100K-1M      | Auto-scaling group, DB cluster
Tier 4 (Enterprise) | 1M+          | Multi-region deployment
```
